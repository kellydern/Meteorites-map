# Meteorites Map

## Project Description
Visualize a large set of meteorite strikes as a map. The Goal  of the project was to transform a spreadsheet describing 34,000 meteor strikes into a visualization that places each event on the map with a marker scaled to reflect the relative sizes of the meteorites. 

## Tools
Processing
Adobe Illustrator
Google Sheets

## Use
* Export the image as a PDF
* Add the ability to edit the text in Illustrator
* f = createFont("Avenir-Medium", 12); 

## Editing in Illustrator
* Open the file
* Processing will put a clipping mask around the entire object. Release the clipping mask (Command > Option > 7)
* Now group everything by type (map, background, meteorites, line, text and ocean). Use select > Y to select all similar objects/colors.
* You can now adjust the color, type and transparency of all the objects, since they're grouped by type.
* If labels are overlapped, select the data point and flip it over the horizonal axis (O > Enter)
* Switch to outline mode to see the edge of the spheres for more accuracy.
